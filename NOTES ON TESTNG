TestNG jar is to be imported from Project Structure in IntelliJ - Modules - Dependencies by clicking on the Plus button

Refer to this video - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjv3MNDo52Y

A class is created. Always use a project for Test in Test NG but you can also do it normal way of directory(Project-New) but add from project structure
the dependencies.
A class is usually written the way it is. Each method or tests are marked with @Test(priority = 1) and so on above every method(tests). These
are called annotations. TestNG is also imported on the class with 
import org.testng.Assert;
import org.testng.annotations.*;

When you have written the class, the main method is not required. Click on the directory(project name) on left pane. Right click and see there will be a option as
"Create TestNG XML". Then testNG xml will be listed on the left pane. Usually a refresh in required (google it for shortcut") but latest version dont need it.
Double click on testNG.xml
It will be like this

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE suite SYSTEM "http://testng.org/testng-1.0.dtd">
<suite name="All Test Suite">
    <test verbose="2" preserve-order="true" name="/home/ashwin/IdeaProjects/Selenium Concepts">


        <classes>
            <class name="TestNGExample"/>
            <class name="Bundle1"/>
        </classes>

    </test>
</suite>


Here <classes> will be entered. IT will auto generate and mention class <class name = "..."/> Add / just as shown in above.

In Intellij thats not all. Now goto Run →Edit Configuration → Templates →TestNG
In xml file there should be XML should have the https endpoint https://testng.org/testng-1.0.dtd just as it is above

Add this--> -Dtestng.dtd.http=true in VM Options

-ea -Dtestng.dtd.http=true  <------

Apply and OK

NOW, for test report generation!
Goto Run - Edit Configuration - Select testNG.xml not in templates
Goto Listeners and add from plus sign and add
org.testng.reporters.EmailReporter
org.testng.reporters.FailedReporter
